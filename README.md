# My configuration files

Using iTerm2

**Notes:**
- The terminal-prompt is only compatible with the bash-shell. If you are using /bin/zsh it wont work.


**TODO**
- Because .vimrc are loaded before ftplugin-files -> when I add a specific theme for a filetype, i.e python-files. All the colors set in .vimrc are overwritten. Thus, I have to manually set them on each file if I wan't them to  stay consistent
- The default shell for iOS is now /bin/zsh, so I should make that work as well, but still have /bin/bash for ubuntu
- When running command `make postgres` I should be sure that homebrew is already installed, must find a way to run `make homebrew` if it's not already installed
